            <p>In the spring of 2017, after several years staffing the kitchen at the local McDonalds, I was trained on cleaning and maintaining our ice cream machines and grills.
                Being a computer science major, I quickly discovered that both units were controlled completely electronically and instantly became fascinated with their operation. I spent
                several months learning all I could about the operation of our ice cream machines, reading up on the operator and technical manuals, and studying wiring diagrams. It quickly
                became apparent to management that my potential as a service expert was wasted on the register, and so I was gradually given more and more freedom to maintain and service
                our machines. After some brief research, I discovered that the manufacturer of these units, Taylor Commercial Foodservice, offered full factory training for McDonald's own
                service techs.
                In January of 2019, I travelled to AVO in Texas and I earned my Electrical Safety Certification for the foodservice industry. This was the first step on a larger journey.
                My ultimate goal was to become a certified Taylor Service Technician. In July, I was sent to Taylor's headquarters for the freezer and grill certification seminar. Over the
                course of two weeks, I learned practically everything there is to know about the Taylor Heat Treatment Combination Shake/Soft Serve machines. We received hands-on training
                with the ice cream heating and refrigeration systems, the mechanical function of all internal components, and we were even trained extensively on circuit board troubleshooting.
                After the training session I am proud to say I passed the certification exam and earned my Taylor Service Technician Badge.
